# ist_site

A re-designed website for RIT's School of Information that uses AJAX to fetch data from both a given proxy file and an internally customized API; and loads page content dynamically with jQuery (Note. The Javascript source code is still in development and requires additional refactoring).

### Major Web Design Considerations:
* Readability
* Compliance with RIT's latest typography and font choice (Helvetica Neue).
* Scalability
* Mobile friendly 
* Transparent look and feel

Below is the new look for the site:<br>
